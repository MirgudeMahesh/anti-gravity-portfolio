git stash                  git stash is a command used to temporarily save (or "stash") uncommitted changes 
                           in your local working directory and index, allowing you to switch branches or work
                           on something else with a clean working directory. The stashed changes are stored locally in a stack and can be reapplied later

git stash pop              which changes done by git stash

BRANCH CREATION:
______________________________

git branch feature        creating a branch feature(head is pointing to the feature branch)

git checkout main          head back to main branch

git merge feature          merge feature branch to main

procedure: 
we cant make changes directly to someones project we need to fork 
thier github repo initially and clone 
then create a branch and do a pull request

1 branch = 1 pull request 
create multiple branches to do multiple commits 
or else all the changes will be on one branch which is tough to maintain



Commands to create folder and file in it using commands:
____________________________________________
C:\Users\Pulse>mkdir learngit  (create folder)

C:\Users\Pulse>cd learngit  (entering into folder)

C:\Users\Pulse\learngit>echo Hello World>file.txt (create file and write content in it)

C:\Users\Pulse\learngit>type file.txt(check what is there in there)
